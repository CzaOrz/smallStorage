Hello everyone. I'm facing this above problem when my input image is the
attached file.

My os: ubuntul4.04

My input image: in attached file(which is a .png file)

My command: tesseract 0a2d.png out

My output: "Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine v4.00.00alpha with
Leptonica

Warning. Invalid resolution 0 dpi. Using 70
instead.

Estimating resolution as 281

Empty page!!

Estimating resolution as 281

This engine is supposed to give the correct answer "0a2d"
I'm new to this ocr engine, so anyone can help me with this problem, many
thanks:)
